Forum built with node.js

## Prerequisites
npm canvas is currently required by the forum to produce captchas. The packages that it requires to run are listed on the [npm package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/canvas)

## Installation
1. `npm i` to install packages.

2. `npm run build` to build ts, and compile clientside assets.

3. `npm run server` to host.

Optionally, `npm run quick` can be run for development builds (builds code to dev, and then starts server)
